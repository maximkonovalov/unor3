This is a sketch for the octopus project here

https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Build_a_Walking_Robot_Theo_Jansen_Style_3D_Printed_Octopod_41bd8bdb.html

This is an Arduino Uno R3 coupled together with a L293D motor shield.
An IR transceiver is connected to the pin #12.

IRremote library should be < 2.6.0 as they changed the interface
greatly later.
